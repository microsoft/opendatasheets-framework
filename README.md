# Open Datasheets

The Open Datasheets framework is a simple, standardized no-code way to document datasets. It is inspired by the concept of [datasheets for datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) and [Understanding Machine Learning Practitioners' Data Documentation Perceptions, Needs, Challenges, and Desiderata](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3555760) research papers. The framework is designed to be both machine-readable and human-readable, serving as a tool for dataset creators to document their datasets and for dataset consumers to understand the datasets they are using.

By integrating directly with GitHub, the framework allows you to create, edit, and export your Open Datasheets directly to GitHub. It leverages the widely used [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) standard to describe the dataset and its metadata, benefiting from the support of various tools and libraries. Additionally, it extends this standard to incorporate responsible AI aspects into the dataset documentation, derived from [Microsoftâ€™s Aether data documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2022/07/aether-datadoc-082522.pdf). This includes information about the dataset's provenance, collection process, privacy and security considerations, and more.

Adhering to good data documentation practices is crucial for responsible AI, as it helps assess how a dataset may impact machine learning models and other solutions derived from it.

The primary goal of this framework is to facilitate dataset documentation, promote transparency, and aid dataset creators and consumers in making informed decisions about the suitability of specific datasets and the limitations they may have. This framework achieves its goal by applying a no-code approach, making it accessible to both non-technical data producers and those with a technical background. For more detailed information, you can refer to our paper titled "[Open Datasheets: Machine-readable Documentation for Open Datasets and Responsible AI Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06153)".

# Try the No-Code App
We have created a no-code web tool to help you create, edit, generate, and export an Open Datasheets `datapackage.json` file for your datasets directly to/from GitHub. You can also work with files located locally on your computer. 

You can try it out here: [https://microsoft.github.io/opendatasheets](https://microsoft.github.io/opendatasheets).

With the no-code tool, you have the ability to:
- Create a new Open Datasheets datapackage from scratch.
- Generate a new Open Datasheets datapackage from data located on GitHub or a local file.
- Modify an existing Open Datasheets datapackage file from GitHub or a local file.
- Save an Open Datasheets datapackage file to GitHub or locally.
